ScribblerDemo
=============

Demo of my scribbler algorithm.

The scribbler algorithm takes an arbitrary image and converts it into an interesting and artistic vector image. When viewed
closely, the image looks like random scribbles, but from a distance it resembles the original and the effect is pretty
magical!

Here's an example:
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qdzU7J-pHrY/UnivEiljkdI/AAAAAAAAvcc/252TgyRmiZE/w899-h674-no/Screen+Shot+2013-11-05+at+12.38.55+AM.png">

The algorithm works best on images that do not need fine details to be recgnizable. In other words, pictures that would
look good even when sized very small. Portraits seem to work great in many cases.
